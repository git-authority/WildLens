# WildLens: A Comprehensive Wildlife Identification Solution

WildLens is a powerful web application designed to bridge the gap between wildlife enthusiasts and the animal kingdom. Utilizing state-of-the-art AI models, WildLens identifies wildlife species from both images and videos, providing users with detailed insights into the creatures they encounter. From life expectancy to natural habitats, WildLens offers an in-depth look at wildlife, aiming to create a stronger connection between people and the environment.

At WildLens, we are driven by the belief that knowledge and awareness can lead to better conservation efforts. With our user-friendly platform, we empower users to learn about the world around them and take steps toward preserving our planet's incredible biodiversity.

## How It Works

WildLens uses advanced machine learning models to analyze images and videos uploaded by users. For videos, WildLens breaks them down into individual frames and processes each frame just as it would an image. By comparing the content against a vast dataset of wildlife information, WildLens predicts the species and provides a wealth of additional information, including:

1. **Predicted Wildlife**: Identifies the species in the image or video.
2. **Potential Threats**: Lists any known threats the species faces.
3. **Conservation Status**: Provides information on whether the species is endangered or under less threat.
4. **Description**: A brief overview of the species, including its characteristics and behaviors.
5. **Fun Fact**: An interesting fact about the species to engage users.
6. **Natural Habitat**: Details about the typical environments where the species is found.
7. **Breed of the Wildlife**: Information on different breeds or subspecies.
8. **Life Expectancy**: The average lifespan of the species.
9. **Origin**: A historical look at where the species originated.
10. **Current Locations**: Lists regions or countries where the species is currently found.

## Tech Stack

WildLens is built with a robust tech stack to ensure smooth performance and accurate predictions:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Supporting Libraries**: NumPy, Pillow, OpenCV
- **Excel Integration**: Openpyxl for handling wildlife data
- **Model Architecture**: VGG16 for image and video frame classification

### Video Predictions

WildLens extends its capabilities to video predictions, providing the same level of detail as it does for images. The system breaks videos into frames and processes each frame individually to predict the wildlife species present in the video. This makes WildLens a versatile tool for users who capture wildlife in motion and want to understand more about the species featured in their videos.

## Additional Features

WildLens continues to evolve with future updates planned to improve the user experience. Here are some of the key features we plan to develop:

- **Improved AI Models**: Enhance prediction accuracy and processing speed.
- **Expanded Database**: Integrate more species into our dataset, covering a broader range of wildlife.
- **User Contributions**: Allow users to contribute their findings and wildlife data to enrich the platform's resources.

## Future Vision

Our vision for WildLens is to become a go-to platform for wildlife identification and conservation efforts. We plan to integrate real-time data on wildlife sightings, expand our educational resources, and build a community of wildlife enthusiasts who can share their discoveries and insights.

## Learning and Experience

Building WildLens has been an exciting journey filled with challenges and learning opportunities. From mastering TensorFlow to handling real-time video predictions, the team has gained invaluable experience in both machine learning and web development. Our goal is to continue improving WildLens, making it more accurate, user-friendly, and informative for wildlife lovers everywhere.
